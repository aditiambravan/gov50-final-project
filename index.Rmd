## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to...

Crime and safety
- Analyzing crime numbers based on demographics and areas is of interest to me as someone who has worked with crime rates and is from Chicago.

2024 Election Horse Race
- Analyzing the candidates based off of popularity and factors that could determine their success in the upcoming presidential election. However, I am skeptical of the availability of data to execute this idea.

Healthcare Access and Outcomes: 
- It would be interestiong to use healthcare data from government sources to analyze factors affecting healthcare access, and subsequently, patient outcomes. It would be interesting to look into vaccine rates and healthcare disparities specifically.
